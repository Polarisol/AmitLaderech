This applies to array cells

2. include the 'HebrewConversions.h' file in your code
3. add the 'HebrewConversions.c' file to your project (Edit->add files to project)
4. When you read a Hebrew string from file use the 'HebrewConverter_convertHebrewUTF8toISO' function before Seting a CVI control value.
5. When you read a Hebrew string from a CVI control use the 'HebrewConverter_convertHebrewISOtoUTF8' function before writing it to file (note that the string will double in size)
